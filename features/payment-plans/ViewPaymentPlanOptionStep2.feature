    As a customer, I should be able to see payment plan options in Step 2.

    #* AC1: Upfront payment:
    #*      There should be only one upfront price
    #*      Text should be:
    #*              Upfront  (first row)
    #*              $ <upfont_price> pay once (second row)

    #* AC2: Installment plans:
    #*      There must be total <num> Payment Plans
    #*      There can be <number_of_installments> installments
    #*      If there are installments:
    #*            Text should be
    #*            <number_of_installments> Installments (first row)
    #*           $ <monthly_price> per month (second row)
    #*            Installment plans should be unique
