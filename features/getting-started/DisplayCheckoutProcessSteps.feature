Feature: Display the steps of the checkout process

    As a customer, I should be able to know where I am in the checkout process using the stepper.

    #* AC1: The system should display the steps of the checkout process as "1-Start Application", "2-Payment Plan", and "3-Review".
    #* AC2: The system should highlight "Start Application" in blue.
    #* AC3: The system should display "Payment Plan" and "Review" in grey.
